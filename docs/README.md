# Python installation
Ensure to have the latest 64-bit version of [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) installed on your computer. Prepare the `base` environment like this (alternatively create a dedicated `env`, requires `autobuild.bat`to be updated)

* `conda activate base`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  

Now you can host the Sphinx documentation locally by executing the `autobuild.bat` script.
